    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p id="paragraf">
        The <span class="highlight-target">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta</span> 
        is an <span class="highlight-target">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. 
        Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
        <span class="highlight-target">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span><br><br>

        The <span class="highlight-target">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter 
        in the management of the <span class="highlight-target">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. 
        This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. 
        PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are 
        <span class="highlight-target">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs.</span> 
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as 
        <span class="highlight-target">Building Engineering Education</span>, and 
        <span class="highlight-target">Mechanical Engineering Education.</span> 
        To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, 
        PTIK will conduct <span class="highlight-target">resource sharing with the mathematics study program.</span>
